## Pages setup and main configuration
The main configuration file for the website is `index.html` file in the directory which defines the content of the navbar and other site-wide features.

It would be best if you replaced the default values of the navigation bar and descriptions and contents in other sections of the `index.html` file with your desired content.

Also, it is better to replace the titles of the buttons with the values you need and adjust the links of the buttons to the relevant sections based on your needs.

Set the link of your social pages and adjust the icons, titles, and links in the footer section according to your needs.

In the end, by executing the `npm run build` in the command line create the final production version in the `dist` folder and only upload the `dist` folder on your host
